CyberArk is a leading security solution that focuses on privileged access management. In the context of CyberArk and many other IT systems, the terms "FailOverMode", "FailBack", and "FailOver" relate to high availability and disaster recovery mechanisms. Here's a brief overview of these terms:

1. **FailOver**:

   - **Definition**: Failover is the process of switching to a redundant or standby system, server, hardware component, or network upon the failure or abnormal termination of the previously active system.
   - **In CyberArk**: If the primary CyberArk server (or any other component) becomes unavailable, the system will automatically switch to a secondary or backup server to ensure continuous service availability. This process is transparent to the end-users, ensuring that there's no disruption in service.

2. **FailOverMode**:

   - **Definition**: This typically refers to the mode or state the system is in when it has switched to the backup or secondary system due to a failure in the primary system.
   - **In CyberArk**: When the primary server is down, and the system has switched to the backup server, it's said to be in "FailOverMode". In this mode, certain functionalities might be limited or operate differently compared to when the primary server is active.

3. **FailBack**:
   - **Definition**: Failback is the process of restoring a system, component, or service back to its primary state or location after it has been shifted to a backup or secondary location during a failover.
   - **In CyberArk**: Once the issues with the primary server are resolved and it's back online, the system can be switched back from the secondary server to the primary server. This process of returning to the primary server is known as "FailBack". It ensures that the primary system is once again the active system, and the secondary system returns to its standby state.

In essence, these mechanisms ensure that CyberArk services remain available even in the face of failures, providing resilience and high availability to its users.
