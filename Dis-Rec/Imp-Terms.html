			CyberArk is a leading security solution that focuses on privileged access
			management. In the context of CyberArk and many other IT systems, the
			terms &quot;FailOverMode&quot;, &quot;FailBack&quot;, and
			&quot;FailOver&quot; relate to high availability and disaster recovery
			mechanisms. Here's a brief overview of these terms:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><strong>FailOver</strong>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Definition</strong>: Failover is the process of switching to
						a redundant or standby system, server, hardware component, or
						network upon the failure or abnormal termination of the previously
						active system.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>In CyberArk</strong>: If the primary CyberArk server (or any
						other component) becomes unavailable, the system will automatically
						switch to a secondary or backup server to ensure continuous service
						availability. This process is transparent to the end-users, ensuring
						that there's no disruption in service.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>FailOverMode</strong>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Definition</strong>: This typically refers to the mode or
						state the system is in when it has switched to the backup or
						secondary system due to a failure in the primary system.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>In CyberArk</strong>: When the primary server is down, and
						the system has switched to the backup server, it's said to be in
						&quot;FailOverMode&quot;. In this mode, certain functionalities
						might be limited or operate differently compared to when the primary
						server is active.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>FailBack</strong>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Definition</strong>: Failback is the process of restoring a
						system, component, or service back to its primary state or location
						after it has been shifted to a backup or secondary location during a
						failover.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>In CyberArk</strong>: Once the issues with the primary
						server are resolved and it's back online, the system can be switched
						back from the secondary server to the primary server. This process
						of returning to the primary server is known as &quot;FailBack&quot;.
						It ensures that the primary system is once again the active system,
						and the secondary system returns to its standby state.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			In essence, these mechanisms ensure that CyberArk services remain
			available even in the face of failures, providing resilience and high
			availability to its users.
