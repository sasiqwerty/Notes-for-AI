		<h2>Disaster Recovery</h2>
		<p>
			In this section we will test the Disaster Recovery (DR) procedures for
			automatic failover and manual failback. The exercise will include the
			following steps:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				First, we will configure the Disaster Recovery module on the DR server
				to perform an automatic failover in case the Primary Vault is no longer
				reachable.
			</li>
			<li>
				We will execute a full replication from the Primary Vault to the DR
				Vault.
			</li>
			<li>
				We will test an automatic failover from the Primary Vault to the DR
				Vault. As part of the test, we will also confirm that our end users can
				still access critical systems via CyberArk, without any human
				intervention.
			</li>
			<li>
				We will set the Primary Vault to act as DR and replicate all data back
				from the DR Vault to the Primary Vault.
			</li>
			<li>
				We will then perform a manual failback from the DR Vault to the Primary
				Vault
			</li>
			<li>
				Lastly, we will set the DR Vault back to DR mode and confirm our end
				users are still able to connect to critical systems via CyberArk.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Note : The below steps have already been performed by the implementation
			team:
		</p>
		<p>
			The PrivateArk Server, PrivateArk Client, and Disaster Recovery module
			have all been installed on both your vault01a and DR servers by the
			implementation team.
		</p>
		<p>
			A second DR user called “DR_Failback” was manually created by the
			implementation team during the deployment of the Primary Vault for the
			purpose of supporting the failback procedure from the DR site back to the
			primary site.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, both the DR and DR_Failback users are currently disabled. You
			will need to enable these users to complete the Disaster Recovery
			exercises.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 1: Enable Automatic Failover on the DR Vault</h3>
		<p>
			As noted above, the implementation team has already installed the
			PrivateArk Server, PrivateArk Client and Disaster Recovery service on the
			DR server. However, to avoid an unwanted automatic failover during the
			first days of the course, automatic failover was disabled, and the DR user
			deactivated. We are now going to enable the DR user and Automatic Failover
			to the DR Vault.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note : Do NOT change the password as the DR user has already authenticated
			to the Vault during initial implementation and the password for the user
			has already been rotated. If you change the password to Cyberark1, you
			will need to create a new cred file as well. The DR user is located under
			the System branch.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				On the Components server, connect as the Administrator user with the
				PrivateArk Client to the Primary Vault and enable the DR user.
			</li>
			<li>
				Next, power on the 08-DR server. Remember, it will take a moment for the
				machine to start.
			</li>
			<li>Sign into Windows on the DR server as Administrator.</li>
			<li>
				Open the file explorer and navigate to C:\Program Files
				(x86)\PrivateArk\PADR\Conf. Double click on the padr.ini file to edit it
				with Notepad
			</li>
			<li>
				Change the EnableFailover setting to Yes and delete the last two lines
				of the file (if present). This will trigger a full replication when we
				restart the Disaster Recovery service, ensuring we have the most
				up-to-date data.
			</li>
			<li>Save the file and exit Notepad.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Notice FailoverMode is currently set to No. Do NOT change this setting. It
			will automatically change later when we test the failover process.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2: Execute a full replication to the DR Vault</h3>
		<p>
			In this step, we will simply re-start the CyberArk Disaster Recovery
			service. In so doing, the service will read the changes we made to the
			file PADR.ini.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				On the DR server, open the Windows Services applet. There is a shortcut
				in the taskbar.
			</li>
			<li>Restart the CyberArk Vault Disaster Recovery service</li>
			<li>
				Now go to the desktop. Right click on the Get-DR-log.ps1 file located on
				the desktop and select Run with PowerShell.
			</li>
			<li>
				Confirm the Disaster Recovery module has completed the replication of
				data from the Primary Vault. You should see entries with informational
				codes PAREP013I Replicating Safe and at the end, PADR0010I Replicate
				ended.
			</li>
			<li>
				Back on the Components server, login to the PVWA as Mike. Navigate to
				SYSTEM HEALTH to review the current system health. Note hat currently
				Vault 10.0.10.1 is considered PRIMARY while Vault 10.0.14.1 is
				considered DR.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Step 3: Execute Automatic Failover Test</h3>
		<p>
			Now, we will execute an automatic failover test by stopping the Primary
			Vault server. If everything works as expected the Disaster Recovery module
			on the DR server will recognize that the Primary Vault is offline and
			trigger an automatic failover.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sign into Windows on the Primary Vault server (Vault01A) as Administrator.
			Open the Server Central Administration app and stop click on the red
			traffic light to stop PrivateArk Server service. Once the Primary Vault
			has stopped, return to the console of the DR Server. Monitor the the tail
			on the padr.log file. You should see messages stating that the Disaster
			Recovery service is unable to reach the Primary Vault After 5 failures,
			the DR Vault will go into failover mode (this is the default setting).
			Check the padr.log and review the sequence of events.
		</p>
		<h4>Confirm Automatic Failover on the DR Vault</h4>
		<p>
			On the DR server (10.0.14.1), open the Windows Services applet and confirm
			the CyberArk Vault Disaster Recovery service has terminated. Confirm the
			PrivateArk Server service is now running on the DR server (10.0.14.1).
		</p>
		<h4>Confirm Automatic Failover of PVWA and PSM</h4>
		<p>
			In this section we will confirm our end users (like John) can still access
			critical systems via CyberArk, even though the Primary Vault is offline,
			without human intervention.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note the implementation team has already configured the PVWA and PSM to
			automatically failover to the DR Vault when the Primary Vault is no longer
			available. To support automatic failover, the Vault.ini file for both
			services has been configured with the IP addresses of both the Primary
			Vault and the DR Vault separated by a comma.
		</p>
		<p>Here you can see the configuration of the PVWA Vault.ini file.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				To confirm that both the PVWA and PSM automatic failover was successful,
				return to the console of the Components server.
			</li>
			<li>
				Open Chrome and verify that you can still login to the PVWA as John,
				even though the Primary Vault is offline.
			</li>
			<li>
				Now, verify you can launch a secure session to the target Windows
				machine using the localadmin01 account via PSM. If everything worked as
				expected, John should still be able to access the target server via
				CyberArk, without any human intervention.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note: You may need to try to launch the connection via PSM a couple of
			time before it works, as it may take a few minutes before the PSM fails
			over to the DR Vault.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 4: Execute a full replication back to the Primary Vault</h3>
		<p>
			Before we failback to the Primary Vault we must first make sure we
			replicate all the latest data from the DR Vault (which served as the
			active Vault for the duration of resolving the incident). In this section
			we will use the Disaster Recovery module on vault01a to replicate data back
			from the DR Vault to the Primary Vault.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note: The implementation team has already installed the Disaster Recovery
			module on vault01a, and manually created a separate DR user for the
			purpose of performing replication from the DR Vault back to the Primary
			Vault.
		</p>
		<p>
			The new user is called DR_Failback, and has been made a member of the
			built-in group DR_Users. The user was assigned the following Vault
			authorizations: Backup All Safes and Restore All Safes.
		</p>
		<p>
			From Components, use PrivateArk Client to connect to the DR Vault and
			enable the user DR_Failback.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note: Do NOT change the password as the DR_Failback user has already
			authenticated to the Vault during initial implementation, and the password
			for the user has already been rotated. If you change the password to
			Cyberark1, you will need to create a new cred file as well.
		</p>
		<p>The DR_Failback user is located under the System branch.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Open the console on vault01a (10.0.10.1).</li>
			<li>
				Open the file explorer and navigate to C:\Program Files
				(x86)\PrivateArk\PADR\Conf.Double click on the padr.ini file to edit it
				with Notepad.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make the following changes to the padr.ini file on vault01a:
				<ul>
					<li>Set FailoverMode to No.</li>
					<li>
						Delete the last two lines (log number and timestamp of the last
						successful replication) in the file.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Save the file and close it.</li>
			<li>
				Start the ‘CyberArk Disaster Recovery’ Service on the Primary Vault
			</li>
			<li>
				Right click on the Get-DR-log.ps1 file located on the desktop of the
				vault01a and select Run with PowerShell.
			</li>
			<li>
				Monitor the tail of the padr.log to verify that the Primary Vault has
				replicated all the changes from the DR Vault. On the Components server,
				login to the PVWA as Mike. Navigate to SYSTEM HEALTH to review the
				current system health. Note that now Vault 10.0.10.1 is considered DR
				while Vault 10.0.14.1 is considered PRIMARY.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note Contrary to the PVWA and PSM, the CPM is not configured to perform an
			automatic failover, which is why it is showing as disconnected in the
			image above. This is to avoid the situation of split brain between the two
			Vaults. To support password rotation in the DR site, we will need to
			manually failover the CPM to the DR Vault (by setting the DR Vault IP
			address in the vault.ini file of the CPM). We will not perform manual
			failover for the CPM in this exercise.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 5: Execute failback procedure by using Manual Failover</h3>
		<p>
			Now that all the data has been replicated back from the DR Vault to the
			Primary Vault, we can proceed with performing a manual failback from the
			DR Vault to the Primary Vault. The failback procedure will be performed
			using a Manual Failover.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Make sure you are working on vault01a (10.0.10.1).</li>
			<li>
				Open the file explorer and navigate to C:\Program Files
				(x86)\PrivateArk\PADR\Conf. Double click on the padr.ini file to edit it
				with Notepad.
			</li>
			<li>Set ActivateManualFailover to Yes</li>
			<li>Save the file and close it.</li>
			<li>
				Restart the CyberArk Disaster Recovery service on vault01a (10.0.10.1).
				The service should start and stop immediately (because of the
				ActivateManualFailoversetting). Then the PrivateArk Server service
				should start.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Important: The above steps are critical for a successful failback from the
			DR Vault to the Primary Vault. Reverting to the Primary Vault without
			first performing a proper failover can result in data inconsistencies.
		</p>
		<h4>Confirm Manual Failover on the Primary Vault</h4>
		<p>
			Monitor the tail running on the padr.log file on vault01a (10.0.10.1).
			Confirm you can see the messages stating that the Failover process ended
			successfully, that the Vault service is starting, and that the Disaster
			Recovery service has terminated. Verify that the the CyberArk Vault
			Disaster Recovery service has terminated on vault01a (10.0.10.1) Verify
			that the PrivateArk Server service has started successfully on vault01a
			(10.0.10.1).
		</p>
		<h3>Step 6: Set the DR server back to DR mode</h3>
		<p>
			In the last section of this exercise, we will set the DR server back to DR
			mode.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Return to the console of DR (10.0.14.1).</li>
			<li>
				On the DR server, edit the padr.ini file and make the following changes:
				<ul>
					<li>Set FailoverMode to No.</li>
					<li>
						Delete the last two lines (log number and timestamp of the last
						successful replication) in the file.
					</li>
					<li>Save and exit the file.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Using the Windows Services applet, stop the PrivateArk Server service on
				DR (10.0.14.1).
			</li>
			<li>
				Then, start the CyberArk Vault Disaster Recovery service on DR
				(10.0.14.1).
			</li>
			<li>
				Check the tail running on the padr.log file on the DR server (10.0.14.1)
				and confirm that a full replication process started and that the
				replication (from the Primary Vault to the DR Vault) has ended
				successfully.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Confirm Automatic Failover for PVWA and PSM</h4>
		<p>
			In this step we will confirm that our end users can still access critical
			systems via CyberArk.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Login to the PVWA as John and launch a secure connection to the target
				Windows machine using the account localadmin01. If everything works as
				expected, John should be able to launch the secure connection without
				any human intervention.
			</li>
			<li>
				Lastly, login to the PVWA as Mike and navigate to SYSTEM HEALTH. Confirm
				server 10.0.10.1 once again acts as PRIMARY and server 10.0.14.1 acts as
				DR. Confirm all other components are connected.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note: It may take a little longer for the PSM for SSH service to failover,
			but eventually it should failover to the functioning Vault. Important: Due
			to some limitations in our lab, it is important to disable both the DR and
			the DR_Failback users (using the PrivateArk Client) until the time you
			want to work again on the disaster recovery exercise
